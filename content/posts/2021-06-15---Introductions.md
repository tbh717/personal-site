The year is 2021. My prior personal website was a unmaintainable, overly complicated that mangled and dumbed down the very capable Jekyll static site generator system into a simple portfolio site and cut out the blogging features.

Very little is different this time except the choice of SSG, as I've since switched to a Gatsby / Netlify flow. This time, however, I asked myself: "why waste a perfectly good blog-aware framework?"

So, at the very least, with the existence of this post, I know I'm not wasting all that fancy wiring.

I don't expect to use this a lot, as my internet blogging experience starts and ends with a few obscure music reviews I wrote of Warped-Tour-core albums while sitting on the gym floor in a high school basketball class.

There's a few shiny SSO enhancing and Google Analytics analyzing goodies built into this framework, but I don't expect to use them. So I reckon that if you're here, it's probably not to read blog posts.

But thanks for reading this one. There's definitely a non-zero chance I'll catch you in another one down the road.
